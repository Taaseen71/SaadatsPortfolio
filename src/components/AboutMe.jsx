                    Hi there, welcome! My Name is Saadat. <br /> <br />
                    I’m a full stack developer based in New York city. I love creating e-commerce sites and design/create anything related animation. I like creating minimalistic, visually appealing websites that run seamlessly across platforms, using React, Vanilla javascript, Ruby or Node.js and other languages <br /><br />

                    I left my career as a chemist because I have always been drawn to technology. I am drawn to coding  because I love building things and want to transfer the same fun experience on to the user. <br /><br />

                    When i’m not working I am creating things in the world of music.
                    <br /><br />
